This is my first coding project, ever. It's pretty bad, and it took me like 4 hours, and it's super elementary, but it works. Even though it displays an error code at the end of it, it works. It probably only works on Mac as well, and I think the way it searches for files is native to my own Mac, so it might not even work for other people, but it's a start.

I recently joined a school club, where one of the orientation tasks is to coffee chat 15 of the older members. Their contact information is available on a Google Sheet, and I have to text them individually. So, I made a program that automatically imports the information from the Google Sheet and imports them to my contact book. That's pretty much it. If I had just added the contacts normally, it would've taken 20 minutes, but this way took 4 hours. But hey, it's good practice.
